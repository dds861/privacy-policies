    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 17, 2025</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application
        <strong>“Мақал-Мәтелдер жинағы”</strong> (“we”, “our”, “the App”) handles information
        when you use the App. The App allows users to browse and read Kazakh proverbs.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information such as your
        name, email address, phone number, postal address or social media profile.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, we use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (a service provided by Google LLC)
        to collect <strong>non-personal usage data</strong> that helps us understand how the App
        is used and how we can improve it.
    </p>

    <p>Examples of the data collected by Firebase Analytics include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>screens and sections you view in the App;</li>
        <li>basic information about your device (device model, OS version, language);</li>
        <li>events such as opening the App, tapping buttons or changing settings;</li>
        <li>performance and crash information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Firebase Analytics may use your device’s <strong>Advertising ID (AD_ID)</strong> for
        measurement and analytics purposes. You can reset or limit the use of Advertising ID in
        your device settings at any time.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. How We Use This Data</h2>

    <p>
        We use the analytics data collected via Firebase only for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>to understand how users interact with the App;</li>
        <li>to improve the content and user experience;</li>
        <li>to monitor performance and fix bugs or crashes;</li>
        <li>to ensure the stability and security of the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use this data to show personalised advertising, we do
        <strong>not</strong> sell or rent any data to third parties, and we do
        <strong>not</strong> create user profiles for marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
        The App uses the following third-party service:
    </p>

    <h3>Firebase Analytics (Google LLC)</h3>
    <p>
        Firebase Analytics is used to collect aggregated usage statistics and crash reports.
        The service is provided by Google LLC.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information on how Google processes data, please see Google’s Privacy Policy:<br>
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Depending on your device settings, Google may collect information such as Advertising ID,
        IP address, device identifiers and usage information.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis &amp; Data Retention</h2>

    <p>
        Where applicable (for example, in the European Economic Area), we process analytics data
        based on our legitimate interest in understanding how the App is used and improving it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Analytics data is stored by Google for the period defined in your Firebase Analytics
        project settings and then deleted or aggregated. We do not store analytics data on our own servers.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <p>
        The App is intended for users aged <strong>16 and over</strong>.
        We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16.
        If you believe that a child under 16 has provided any information through the App,
        please contact us so that we can delete it.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>

    <p>You can control how analytics and Advertising ID are used on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            By changing your device settings to limit or reset the
            <strong>Advertising ID</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            On some devices, you may also restrict or disable usage &amp; diagnostics sharing
            with app developers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>

    <p>
        We rely on Google Firebase infrastructure to store and process analytics data.
        Firebase uses industry-standard security measures to protect the data it processes.
        While no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect information processed via the App.
    </p>

    <hr>

        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this
